# Named Entity Recognition
# About NER

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing named entities within a body of text. Named entities are specific objects or entities that have a name, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, quantities, and more. NER systems analyze text to extract these entities and classify them into predefined categories or types, providing valuable information for various downstream NLP tasks such as information extraction, question answering, sentiment analysis, and more.
At its core, NER aims to identify and classify named entities within unstructured text data, enabling machines to understand and process human language more effectively. By automatically recognizing named entities, NER systems can extract important information from large volumes of text, aiding in tasks such as information retrieval, document summarization, and content recommendation.

The process of Named Entity Recognition involves several key steps:

1. Text Preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant information. This step ensures that the text is clean and ready for analysis.

2. Tokenization: The text is split into individual tokens, typically words or phrases, using a tokenizer. Each token represents a unit of meaning in the text and serves as the basic input for the NER system.

3. Named Entity Recognition: The tokenized text is analyzed by the NER system to identify and classify named entities. The system assigns labels to each token, indicating the type of entity it represents (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc.).

4. Entity Classification: After identifying named entities, the NER system classifies them into predefined categories or types based on their semantic meaning. For example, a token representing a person's name would be classified as a PERSON entity, while a token representing a company's name would be classified as an ORGANIZATION entity.

5. Post-processing: Once named entities have been recognized and classified, post-processing techniques may be applied to refine the results and improve accuracy. This may involve resolving ambiguities, handling overlapping entities, and correcting misclassifications.

NER systems can be implemented using various techniques, including rule-based systems, statistical models, and deep learning approaches. Rule-based systems rely on handcrafted rules and patterns to identify named entities, while statistical models use probabilistic algorithms to learn patterns and associations from annotated training data. Deep learning approaches, such as neural networks, employ sophisticated architectures to automatically learn features and representations from raw text data.
One of the most widely used libraries for NER is spaCy, which provides pre-trained models and easy-to-use APIs for performing NER tasks. Other popular NLP libraries, such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and Stanford CoreNLP, also offer NER functionality.
The applications of Named Entity Recognition are diverse and widespread across various domains:

- Information Extraction: NER enables the extraction of specific information from unstructured text data, such as extracting names of people, dates, and locations from news articles or documents.
- Question Answering: NER helps in understanding and answering questions by identifying relevant entities mentioned in the question and retrieving corresponding information from a knowledge base or text corpus.
- Entity Linking: NER can be used to link named entities mentioned in text to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases or databases, enabling cross-referencing and semantic enrichment of data.
- Sentiment Analysis: NER assists in sentiment analysis by identifying named entities associated with positive or negative sentiment, such as product names in customer reviews or brand mentions in social media posts.

## CODE - Description

## Overview

This Python script uses the spaCy library to recognize named entities in a text document. The recognized entities and their corresponding labels are written to an output file. Additionally, you can visualize the named entities using spaCy's built-in visualization tool.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Install spaCy library:
   pip install spacy
2.Download the English language model:
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

### Prepare Input Text File

- Create a text file containing 200-300 words of text.
- Save the file with a descriptive name, such as `input.txt`.

### Run the Script

- Open your preferred Python environment.
- Ensure that the input text file (`input.txt`) is in the same directory as the script.
- Define the input and output file paths in the script (`input_file` and `output_file` variables) if not already defined.
- Run the script.

### Check the Output

- The recognized named entities and their labels will be written to the output file (`output.txt`).
- Each line in the output file contains a named entity followed by its label, separated by a tab character.

### Visualize Named Entities

- After running the script, you can visualize the recognized named entities using spaCy's built-in visualization tool.
